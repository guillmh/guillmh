### Hi there! <img src="https://i.gifer.com/6I5M.gif" width="25"/>
I'm [**Guillber**]([https://www.miraya.tech](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillbermendez))

I'm a **frontend developer** with experience building modern web apps using **React**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**. I enjoy working with reusable components, managing state efficiently, and writing clean, maintainable code.

I'm comfortable consuming **REST APIs**, integrating third-party services, and deploying apps using tools like **Vite**, **GitHub**, **Render**, and **Vercel**.

I also have solid knowledge of **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, which helps me better understand fullstack development and collaborate with backend teams.

Always learning, always building ðŸš€
